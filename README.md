## Credits

Most of my dotfiles are a collection of things I found in other people's dotfiles, and then sometimes tweaked it to my own needs.
A lot of them (especially the general infrastructure) were copied from [Jeremy Felt](https://github.com/jeremyfelt/dotfiles), and my dotfiles were also inspired by:

* [Helen Hou-SandÃ­](https://gist.github.com/helen/8493a6b4b57bfbf1ecaf)
* [Pascal Birchler](https://github.com/swissspidy/dotfiles)
* [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm)
